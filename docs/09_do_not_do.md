# 09 - Do Not Do

This project is explicitly **not** a turnkey trading system. Do not:

- Deploy to live trading without explicit human approval.
- Disable or bypass the kill switch.
- Ignore drawdown or exposure limits.
- Treat mock execution as production readiness.
- Store secrets in the repository.
