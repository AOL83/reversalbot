# Philosophy: Survival Engine

ReversalBot is designed to **trade to live another trade**. The system assumes
markets are uncertain, liquidity can vanish, and signals fail. The only durable
edge is capital preservation.

## Core tenets
- **Survive first**: protective exits and kill controls are mandatory.
- **Spec-first**: rules are written before code changes.
- **Deterministic risk**: sizing and exposure are bounded and explainable.
- **Observability**: every trade path emits structured logs and alerts.

## Expectancy mindset
Expectancy improves only when **downside is bounded** and **errors are caught**.
Stage 1 focuses on those defenses, not on alpha discovery.
