# Philosophy

ReversalBot is risk-first. Every decision path must be safe by default.

## Principles
- Protect capital before pursuing returns.
- Prefer deterministic, testable logic over heuristics.
- Require explicit operator intent for any unsafe action.
- Make failures loud, observable, and recoverable.
